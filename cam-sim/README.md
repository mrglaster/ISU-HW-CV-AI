### Camera simulator with distortion

Make a Python application using the tkinter library, which allows you to dynamically change the image of an object defined by three-dimensional points (load a file in the cube_full.txt format), using changes in perspective transformation parameters (rotations in the XY plane, Znear, Zfar, dX, dY), camera parameters (both focuses) and parameters of radial distortion (coefficient K1 for distortion r^2).

Parameters can be set either manually or using sliders.

The resulting image is dynamically displayed on the application screen
